I shipped my first unsupervised learning model last week, and I still feel a high from it. It was my best project so far, for three reasons. 

First, the results were actually produced insight, which is not always the case. In the commit messages, I found clear, distinct themes. Secondly, I learned a lot during EDA. I experimented with the other clustering models to compare and contrast the results. Lastly, I shipped the API in a Docker container - something that I had been wanting to learn how to do for a long time. 

My next project is a return to my solar roots. The focus will be applying Bayesian regression to PV module soiling.
