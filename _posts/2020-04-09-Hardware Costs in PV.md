I was the performance manager for Antelope Valley Solar Project, also known as Solar Star, which at one point, was the largest solar power plant in North America. The array inverters were supplied by two OEMs: SMA and ABB. I became quite familiar with ABB from reviewing it's operational data, and given that they sold almost 250MW of capacity to that project alone, my (erroneous) sense was that they were doing quite well in the inverter market. 

And then last summer they exited the market. At the time I was shocked, but this graph explains a lot.

This week I sampled the 'solar kit' inventories of a handful of wholesalers, which essentially bundle the generation assets of a system (as opposed to balance of system components). The X axis is system capacity, the Y is price. The coefficient of determination is 94%, meaning the variance in price is almost entirely explained by the system's expected monthly production. Extrapolating this into megawatt scale systems, I interpret this to represent commoditization. There seems to be little space for differentiation. 

It'd be interesting to plot the pricing of the Chinese companies as well.
