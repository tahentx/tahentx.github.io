## Reading Code
#### May 4, 2020

Driven by personal interest as much as professional development, I have spent a few weeks exploring the literature on reading code. Anyone who writes code can appreciate the importance of the skill - and anyone who writes code will probably agree that it's hard to speak about it generally. So much of code is contextual. Nevertheless, I imagined people smarter than me putting pen to paper on the topic, and I found two books to share.

The first is one with an intriguing title I love: Your Code As A Crime Scene by Adam Thornhill. In truth, I didn't find it that good, so I won't read it in it's entirety. But there are some interesting ideas. When you're new to a codebase, to supplement your questions with those familiar with the code, it makes sense to review the commit history systematically. At a high level, you can identify what Thornhill calls 'hotspots' - sections of the code with a lot of activity. You should be strategic in how you approach, armed with additional precious context. 

The second I hope to start soon: Working Effectively With Legacy Code by Michael Feathers. From what I gather, this is the canonical work on the topic. I've listened to Michael on a couple of podcasts and he seems as pleasant as he is brilliant. The clarity and depth of his thinking is impressive.

Code isn't prose. But I hope with disciplined intent, and consistent practice, it will become less of an effort and I'm able to extract what I need more quickly.
