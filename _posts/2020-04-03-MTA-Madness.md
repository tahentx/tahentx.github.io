title: What's Jekyll?
---

This week, my colleagues and I were tasked with exploring NYC's MTA ridership data. Our mandate was to identify the best stations for a women's organization to do outreach. We supplemented the data with some demographic data, but the core of our efforts were on munging and tidying the dataset for analysis. 



> Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

It's an immensely useful tool. Find out more by [visiting the project on GitHub](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
